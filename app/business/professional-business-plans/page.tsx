              <p>Is your business figure still at fives and sixes?</p>
              <p>Do you have an expert business plan?</p>
              <p>If you are cynical about the answer and do not have an overarching goal and a business plan, you are like <span className='font-bold'>Alice in Wonderland</span> with your business!</p>
              <p>A goal without <span className='font-bold'>a plan</span> is simply a <span className='font-bold'>wish!</span></p>
              <p>
                A well-written business plan is critical to position the building blocks of your business to attain the best results. It should be well researched and extensively detailed to guide you and let you know where you approached from and where you are heading. You need it to raise your capital or get a bank loan.
