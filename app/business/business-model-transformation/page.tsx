              Are you a business leader? Then it would be best if you adopted a new playbook for transforming your antiquated business model. Change is inevitable, and awareness is the most exceptional agent to make that change happen. Business model transformation requires business leaders like you to rethink and reform how organizations are creating value and will create value.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is terrible if you do not reinvent your business model from now, but what is even worse is that you did not know that the business model was even a thing that requires transformation!

        What is Business Model Transformation?
      </h1>
      <p className="mt-4 text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        A business model is a recipe that helps you create, deliver, and take value for your company. It is essential to winning in today’s exponentially disrupted business era.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        While you desire to unlock hidden opportunities, reap benefits of transformation, and generate higher revenues, you as an entrepreneur need to think BIG and BOLD.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        The business environment is continuously evolving. That said, it is crucial to have an operating business model, which is progressively transformed to resonate with the progressive changes in the business world.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        To emphasize more on those mentioned above, a recent Forbes Insights/KPMG Report indicates that a significant proportion, 93% of corporations are planning, executing, or have recently completed transforming their business model. This report means they are regularly evolving.
