            <p>
              Before you kick start devising a marketing plan, our experts gather the crucial info about your business and follow the following procedure:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-6">
              <li><span className='font-bold'>CTR:</span>It’s unmistakably imperative to know how many people are really clicking on your ads. Assessing your CTR (Click-Through-Rate) can help you figure out which of your keywords and ads are generally relevant to your audience and prompt them to click on it. We also use CTR to see which ad copy drives the most outcomes.</li>
              <li><span className='font-bold'>Keyword Quality Score:</span> You can determine the quality of your keywords using Google’s quality score of 1 to 10. If your keywords are not ranking above 4, you must change your keywords or find a great strategy to optimize them. </li>
              <li><span className='font-bold'>Impressions:</span> On the off chance that your keywords are excessively explicit, you risk passing up search traffic. So, you should analyze your keywords to see which ones have the lowest number of impressions and decide whether there are more extensive keywords varieties that may attract more eyes.
              </li>
              <li><span className='font-bold'>Conversions:</span>We measure the number of people who have made a phone call or submitted a form to meet a key requirement to maintain the account, and to measure the amount of revenue or impact the campaign makes on your organization. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>It seems complicated. That is why; we are here. We can do this for you by using various relevant keyword tools to find more popular keywords for your nonprofit organization.</p>
