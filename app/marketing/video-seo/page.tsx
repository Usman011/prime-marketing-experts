								Video is one of the most powerful marketing mediums to improve your online presence,
								but you canâ€™t just upload one into Youtube or your website expect it to be shown to
								many people. To achieve the best results, videos require their own genuine strategy
								separate from your main SEO strategy. Video SEO optimizes the rankings of video
								content within Google, Bing, Yahoo, and video search results. We strategically can
								help you ultimately drive more website traffic, as opposed to driving it to your
								video hosting provider.
							</p>
							<p>
								We implement video schema to get videos indexed and improve visibility within search
								engines. Our team then integrates keyword-rich metadata, which includes titles,
								descriptions, cards, custom thumbnails, transcripts, tags, and captions, to attract
								a relevant audience over time. We also then integrate the same link building
								strategies that we use with blog articles, info-graphics, and white papers to
								further improve the ranking of your video content.
