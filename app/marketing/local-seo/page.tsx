              Do you own a local business? Are people finding your local store? Are you struggling with scaling your business? Well, if you are not getting a lot of leads from the search engine, you are not alone.
              </p>
              <p className='font-bold'>Did you know 46% of Google searches are local?</p>
              <p className='font-bold italic'>
              And, 80% of these searches convert.
              </p>
              <p>
              Now, what does this mean? Well, given the facts, if you have a local business and you don’t leverage local SEO, you are missing out on a lot of opportunities.
              </p>
              <p>
              Yes, if you are not on the first page of Google and Bing, you may not get any visitors to your site. You’d be amazed to know that not many people go past the first page.
              </p>
              <p>
              Google’s search results are decidedly personalized based on the company’s geographical location. For instance, a search for pizza places in Boston will deliver different results than such a search within New York City. These searches depend on your country, your state, and even your city.

The local SEO pack is referred to as the three businesses that appear immediately under a map within the search results on a locally relevant keyword.
